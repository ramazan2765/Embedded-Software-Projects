# Embedded Software Projects

**Overview**
This repository is a collection of professional **embedded software projects** developed to demonstrate expertise in low-level programming, real-time operating systems, hardware communication, and IoT solutions.
The projects cover a wide range of technologies, from bare-metal firmware to FreeRTOS-based applications and advanced communication protocols.

The goal is to provide clear, practical examples that reflect industry-grade design, coding standards, and problem-solving approaches used in embedded systems engineering.
